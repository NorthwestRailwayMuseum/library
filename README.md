# Library


# Project Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the online library system designed using a modern web application stack including ReactJS, Material-UI, FastAPI, MySQL, and hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## 1. Frontend

### Technologies
- **ReactJS**: Used to build the user interface for the library system, providing a responsive and interactive experience.
- **Material-UI**: A React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design, used for styling and structuring the frontend components with ready-to-use templates and design elements.

### Hosting
- **Amazon S3**: Hosts the static files (HTML, CSS, JS bundles) of the React application.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: A CDN to distribute the content globally, reducing load times for users regardless of geographic location.

## 2. Backend

### Technology
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python. Chosen for its easy asynchronous support and automatic interactive API documentation (Swagger UI).

### Hosting
- **Amazon EC2**: An Elastic Compute Cloud service to run the FastAPI server. Provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** (Alternative): For simplifying deployment and scaling operations of FastAPI applications. Manages application deployment, from capacity provisioning and load balancing to auto-scaling.

## 3. Database

### Technology
- **MySQL**: Used as the relational database to store library data such as books, user information, and transaction records.

### Hosting
- **Amazon RDS**: Hosts MySQL databases, handling tasks such as provisioning, patches, backup, recovery, failure detection, and repair.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline

### Technologies
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates the release processes for quick and reliable application and infrastructure updates.
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy.
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances.

## 5. Security

### Technology
- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Manages access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

## 6. DNS Management

### Technology
- **AWS Route 53**: Manages the domain names of the application, integrating tightly with other AWS services like Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.

## 7. Monitoring and Management

### Technology
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitors the application and AWS services, collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, and sets alarms.
